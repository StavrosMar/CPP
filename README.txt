Hello World!

As a young engineer i have been introduced to the world of programming quite long time ago (Matlab, FORTRAN).

This is a repository I created for completing advanced (at least for my level) low level C++ features 
in order to better understand the world of computers and also extend my programming as well as the execution speed of my programs.
(And also a good chance to learn a bit of computer science if I may :) )

The Exercises follow the naming convention of the Exercises relevant to http://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html BOOK.

If you have any suggestion on my solutions, please feel free to let me know! 

My email is redenicht@hotmail.com. Just say hi!

Thank you for taking the time to browse my repo.

Keep up the good work!
