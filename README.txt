Hello World!

This is a repository I created primarily for practising the following topics :

* Data Structures (Trees, Lists, HashTables)
* Algorithms (Sort, Search, Graphs)

* Quantitative Finance

* C++ Metaprogramming (Templates)
* C++ inheritance
* Design Patterns with C++
* C++ Concurrency ( Multithreading)
* C++ memory management. 

* C++ exercises from "The C++ Programming Language" from Bjarne Stroustrup : http://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html.


If you have any suggestions, comments, or just want to say hi we can catch-up on redenicht@hotmail.com.

Keep up the good work!

Stavros
