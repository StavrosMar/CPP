1) Find alternative way for iterating overthe elements
   a) Could run a find on vector iterators maybe : Done - implemented with find_if
   b) Maybe implement a find algorithm (?) Maybe after implicitly sorting the Map?
   c) Reimplement so that :
   	*) Sorting at construction level
	*) comparison / insertion at the correct position when [] is invoked
	      * use search algo to find roughly where to put it.
