1) Function pointers  (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12152167/why-is-using-the-function-name-as-a-function-pointer-equivalent-to-applying-them):
	
	Pointers to functions may be used either as (*pf)() or as pf().

	Then all of the following expressions are valid function calls :

	( &f)(); f(); (*f)(); (**f)(); (***f)();
	pf(); (*pf)(); (**pf)(); (***pf)();
