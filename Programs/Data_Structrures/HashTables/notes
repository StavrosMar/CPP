C++ requires arrays to be declared in compile time. Because my tables here depend on N (parameter) which could be Fed by the user, I assigned them to the heap via new operator. Because of the that I had to declare Copy,Move Constructors and a Destructor.

Another to pass the size (if it was not dependent by the user) would be as a template parameter.
